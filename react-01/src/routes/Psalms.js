      <h1>The Book of Psalms</h1>
      <p>
      The book of Psalms expresses worship. 
      Throughout its many pages, Psalms encourages its readers to praise 
      God for who He is and what He has done. 
      The Psalms illuminate the greatness of our God, 
      affirm His faithfulness to us in times of trouble, 
      and remind us of the absolute centrality of His Word.
