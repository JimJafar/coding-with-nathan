      <h1>The Book of Esther</h1>
      <p>
        Book of Esther, book of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old
        Testament. It belongs to the third section of the Judaic canon, known as
        the Ketuvim, or “Writings.” In the Jewish Bible, Esther follows
        Ecclesiastes and Lamentations and is read on the festival of Purim,
        which commemorates the rescue of the Jews from Haman&apos;s plottings.
        The Book of Esther is one of the Megillot, five scrolls read on stated
        Jewish religious holidays. In the Protestant canon, Esther appears
        between Nehemiah and Job. In the Roman Catholic canon, Esther appears
        between Judith and Job and includes six chapters that are considered
        apocryphal in the Jewish and Protestant traditions.
